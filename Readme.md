# TouK - Parking

Small recruitment project


## Additional assumptions

 - The client did not say anything about any logging system and so none is implemented
 - Only one owner is taken in the account
 - Operators do not carry any unique features and so only one operator is taken into account
 - The plates accepted will take form of string of 8 characters where each character is either a letter from 
 english alphabet or  a number
 - "I want to know how much money was earned during a given day." By this I understand that money earned is money that 
 was transferred on the given day. It doesn't matter if the meter was started at earlier date (e.g. yesterday)
